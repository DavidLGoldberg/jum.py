======

A sublime plugin that creates dynamic hot keys to jump around a file

Key Binding
===
Enter jump mode (default): <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd>

TODO
==
* cancel command that defaults to <kbd>esc</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd>.
* immediate jump on input of 2nd character setting option that defaults to true.
* remove unreachable highlights after first character hit (to reduce noise).
* more viewport work, to only label string with in visible view + inherit no scroll on jumpy file.
* label all views across windows with for example layout of two column etc.

Maybes
==
* open as existing file type ie. jumpy_<filename>.<ext> to trigger the same syntax colorign etc.
